# Performance and Experiment Summary

This document summarizes the objectives and expected insights from the experiments conducted within the HierarchicalDB project. The actual quantitative results can be found in the CSV files generated by each experiment (e.g., `exp_1_bloom_metrics.csv`, `exp_4_query_performance.csv`, etc.), as detailed in `README.md`.

## Overview of Experiments

The experiments (`exp1.cpp` - `exp8.cpp`) are designed to evaluate various aspects of the HierarchicalDB system, focusing on resource consumption, index creation time, and query performance under different conditions.

## Key Performance Aspects Investigated

1.  **Resource Consumption (Disk and Memory)**:
    *   **`exp1.cpp` (vs. Database Size)**: Evaluates how the disk and memory footprint of Bloom filter hierarchies scale with the total number of records in the database. This helps understand the storage overhead of the indexing mechanism.
    *   **`exp2.cpp` (vs. Items Per Partition)**: Investigates the impact of `itemsPerPartition` (granularity of hierarchy leaves) on the disk and memory usage of Bloom filter hierarchies. Smaller partitions might lead to larger hierarchies but potentially better pruning.

2.  **Index Creation Time**:
    *   **`exp3.cpp` (vs. Database Size)**: Measures the time taken for initial database population and subsequent Bloom filter hierarchy construction for varying database sizes. This is important for understanding the setup cost.

3.  **Query Performance**:
    *   **`exp4.cpp` (vs. Database Size)**: Compares the execution time of global scans, single-column hierarchical queries, and multi-column hierarchical queries across different database sizes. It also tracks Bloom filter check counts to quantify pruning effectiveness.
    *   **`exp5.cpp` (vs. Items Per Partition)**: Evaluates how the `itemsPerPartition` parameter influences query performance for a fixed database size. This helps find an optimal balance between hierarchy size/granularity and query speed.
    *   **`exp6.cpp` (vs. Bloom Filter Size)**: Assesses how the capacity (`bloomSize`) of individual Bloom filters within the hierarchy affects query performance. Larger Bloom filters have lower false positive rates but consume more memory.
    *   **`exp7.cpp` (vs. Query Selectivity)**: Analyzes how query performance and Bloom filter pruning efficiency change as the number of records matching the query criteria (selectivity) varies. Hierarchical indexing is expected to show greater benefits for more selective queries.
    *   **`exp8.cpp` (vs. Number of Columns)**: Investigates how query performance and pruning efficiency scale as the number of columns participating in multi-column queries changes. This tests the scalability of the multi-column query algorithm.

## Expected Insights

By analyzing the results from these experiments (i.e., the generated CSV files), one can expect to:

*   Understand the trade-offs between Bloom filter parameters (size, items per partition, number of hash functions) and their impact on resource usage and query performance.
*   Quantify the speedup achieved by using hierarchical Bloom filter indexing compared to full scans, for both single and multi-column queries.
*   Identify optimal configurations for the HierarchicalDB system under different data sizes, data distributions (selectivity), and query complexities (number of columns).
*   Assess the scalability of the indexing and querying mechanisms.
*   Validate the effectiveness of the pruning strategies employed by the `dfsQuery` algorithm.
